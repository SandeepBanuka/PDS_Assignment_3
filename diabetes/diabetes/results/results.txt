(A) We can see  mean and sample mean resulted are almost same. This means the sample that is selected reflects the entire data well. 
(B) We can observe that the population BMI percentile is higher than  sample data. Sample data didn't completely capture the population data well.
(C)In the bootstrapping, mean values of bootstrap sample and population is similar. 
For standard deviation the bootstrap is of less value than that of population data set. But for percentile,
 the bootstrap percentile is more than that of population percentile.
